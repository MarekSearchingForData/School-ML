# School-ML-DAT-690
School ML projects
Hey this is some of my work while in school. I elected to write all of my own code, and test my own theories. I avoided using school provided GUI's to gain deeper understand
of the code and purpose of it. 

It includes a bit of everything, Im sure there are some mistakes, or improvements I could have performed but I am happy with what I accomplished at that time.
Please see write ups for details!

-With Thanks,
Marek
